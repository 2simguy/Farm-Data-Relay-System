FDRS has some ability to communicate bi-directionally, meaning you can control water valves on relays or RGB lights with FastLED. This has always been a side-project, and has a few shortcomings, so I don't include it in the main documentation. I do have a better method in mind, which I will roll out sometime before the 2022 holiday season.
